        //leaves everything else as-is.  When I run this script using STPRivilegedTask, I actually get an auth prompt.
        //So it looks like it ought to work.  But... nay.  The setting is not being toggled on the Sharing panel.  I think
        //this is VERY close to working.  I just needed a little more time to debug and work with this 3rd party source.
